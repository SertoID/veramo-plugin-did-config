## Local Development
* `yarn`
* `yarn build` or `yarn watch`
* `yarn generate-plugin-schema`
* `yarn start` or VSCode Debugger (CMD + Shift + D) > Run `OpenAPI server`  

## Installation
```js
yarn add veramo-plugin-did-config
```

## Usage
 
### Programmatically

This plugin relies on the availability of other veramo plugins installed on the same agent.

The minimum Veramo configuration for using this library requires the following dependencies:

```jsx
yarn add @veramo/core @veramo/message-handler @veramo/did-resolver @veramo/credential-w3c @veramo/did-jwt @veramo/data-store did-resolver
```

When initializing your Veramo agent message handler, the order of the handlers matters.
`JwtMessageHandler` should be first.

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "@veramo/core";
import {
  DIDConfigurationPlugin,
  IWellKnownDidConfigurationPlugin,
} from "veramo-plugin-did-config";
import { MessageHandler } from "@veramo/message-handler";
import { CredentialIssuer, W3cMessageHandler } from "@veramo/credential-w3c";
import { DIDResolverPlugin, UniversalResolver } from "@veramo/did-resolver";
import { JwtMessageHandler } from "@veramo/did-jwt";
import { Resolver, DIDResolver } from "did-resolver";

const uniresolver = new UniversalResolver({
  url: "https://uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/",
}) as DIDResolver;

export const agent = createAgent<IWellKnownDidConfigurationPlugin>({
  plugins: [
    new DIDConfigurationPlugin(),
    new MessageHandler({
      messageHandlers: [new JwtMessageHandler(), new W3cMessageHandler()],
    }),
    new DIDResolverPlugin({
      resolver: new Resolver({
        key: uniresolver,
        web: uniresolver,
        ethr: uniresolver,
        ion: uniresolver,
        elem: uniresolver,
        //...
      }),
    }),
    new CredentialIssuer(),
  ],
});
```

Since we are asserting the agent to have a type of `IWellKnownDidConfigurationPlugin` we can access the plugin methods directly.
The `verifyWellKnownDidConfiguration` method will return an object with the provided domain, list of DIDs associated with it,
the JSON DID Configuration which was verified, and a boolean for validity.

```javascript
const { domain, dids, didConfiguration, valid } = await agent.verifyWellKnownDidConfiguration({ domain });
```

### Command line usage

Clone the plugin repo on your machine and configure the agent instance by editing the agent.yml file (or, if youâ€™re simply trying it or joining a hackathon, keep the configuration as it is).

1. Run the following command to execute your agent:
```bash
yarn && yarn build && yarn start
```

2. Execute the following command to generate a DID:
```bash
yarn veramo execute -m identityManagerCreateIdentity -a "{}"
```

3. Execute the following command to generate your Well-Known DID configuration file, using the DID created in the previous step and the domain from your company:
```bash
yarn veramo execute -m generateDidConfiguration -a "{\"dids\":[\"<did>\"],\"domain\":\"<domain>\"}"
```

4. Upload the Well-Known DID Configuration file to the company website and host it under the well-known URI:
`https://<domain>/.well-known/did-configuration.json`

5. Verify your Well-Known DID Configuration running:
```bash
yarn veramo execute -m verifyWellKnownDidConfiguration -a "{\"domain\": \"<domain>\"}"
```
